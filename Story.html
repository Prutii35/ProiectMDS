            <p class = "p1"> It has been more than 200 years since humans have understood that the resources they had on Grolutera are no longer sufficient for their needs. Scientists all over the planet foresaw this long before it actually happened, yet few actually believed it would come to this. However, technology has finally brought humanity to the edge of the rift and the human race faces a seemingly impossible task : should it take the risk of possible destruction and jump into the abyss, should it seek uncharted territory in search for a better life...?</p>

            <p class = "p2">The spatial object XRT 23B was first observed in 2142, when ISTA (INTER-GALACTIC SPACE TRAVEL ASSOCIATION) scientist and lead-researcher Dr. Anatole Zionotos discovered it on a routine scan, on the 15th of August. It appeared to be a planet fundamentally similar to Grolutera, our planet, although much larger. The fact that it hasn't been discovered earlier was incredibly strange, as it stood at an average distance of only 225 million kilometers. He immediately perceived it as a solution to our problems and began a detailed investigation to which he dedicated the rest of his life.  By the time that he died, ISTA knew just enough to begin plotting expeditions for the probing of this new object. Unfortunately, Dr. Anatole died shortly after the first mission (named Conqueror I) was launched and he did not live to witness its landing. The planet's name was then changed to Zionotos, in honor of his extraordinary initiative and work.</p>
